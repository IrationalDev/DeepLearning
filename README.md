# DeepLearning

assignment1.py can be run by itself and will produce 5 graphs containing:
    data visualization
    keras model loss
    keras model training accuracy
    our NN loss
    our NN training accuracy

Further it will print the mean and standart deviation of 10 runs of each of the model in a 0.8 validation split.
